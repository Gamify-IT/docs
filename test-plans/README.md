# test plans

Contains all the test-plans of all our services, and the test plan templates.

## folder structure

the test-plans belong to their corresponding folder. For Example a test plan created for the Moorhuhn frontend:

```
test-plans/minigames/moorhuhn/frontend/plans
```

As soon as a tester has tested a feature according to a test plan, it has to be placed in the `executed` folder

## naming convention

test-plan files should be following this structure

```
name-service-backend/frontend.md
example:
highscore-moorhuhn-frontend.md
```

where `name` is the name of the feature the test plan covers

executed tests should be named

```
date-testername-name-service-backend/frontend.md
example:
2022-08-01-MichaelLinder-highscore-moorhuhn-frontend.md
```
