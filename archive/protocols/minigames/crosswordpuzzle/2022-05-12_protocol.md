## Submission validation

- Should the validation start automatically after filling all tiles or should the user have a button?

### Result

- We use a button, so the validation only starts if the user wants to and has time to think after filling out all tiles
- Waiting till all tiles are filled correctly is not used because it leads to brute-forcing the solution
