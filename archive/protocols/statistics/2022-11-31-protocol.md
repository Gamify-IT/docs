# Meeting Transcript 31.11.2022

In this meeting we discussed whether the statistics feature and the achievment feature will collide while implementing.

- present: Aaron, Max, Florian, Leon

## Will the both features collide?

- **NO**
- achievements will be course-crossed
- while our statistics will be most per course, there should not be (big) collisions

## How to store, request statistics?

- overworld-backend stores global minigame runs (like now highescore, everything all minigames has the same), minigame specific data stores every minigame backend for themselve
- when lecturer interface requests statistics, the request will be sent to the overworld-backend. This collects all needed data (from own database and request data which is not managed by overworld-backend from the minigame backends [site note from Leon: make these requests async])

## Achievement System

We need to store course independant data, like achievements and keybindings, somewhere, most likely in the overworld backend. 

For the achievements there should be a list of all achievements with all relevant information (title, description, progress, accomplished or not, ...) stored for each registered player. There also needs to be an interface for other services (overworld frontend, minigames, ...) to mark certain achievements as accomplished with the needed data (time of accomplishment, ...)

Some checking whether an achievement has been completed needs to be done in the overworld backend as well, that will be discussed in more details later.
