# Meeting Transcript 15.08.2022

Review Sprint 6 Testen

- present: Martin, Michael Jonathan, Gilian, Florian, Max, Aaron,  Timo, Leon H + Coaches + Clients

- absent excused:  Levi, Leon L, Ilijaz

## License problems

- compatability between Unity license(s) and MIT unknown, unlikely to get an answer from the legal department
-> add a disclaimer to the github page:
- work in progress
- research project
- student work
- remove license for Unity repos

## lecturer interface

- add names of npcs
- add info on location or a map (picture)
- descriptions for tasks
- dungeons (and worlds?) in the sidebar should get a greater margin so that it feels more like a tree- instead of a list-view

## new minigame

- simple question answer game
- very basic
- should be a "fast to play" chickenshock, so basically `who wants to be a millionaire?`

## next review date
