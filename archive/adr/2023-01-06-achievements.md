# Achievements

We need to know whether achievements should exist for every course or course independent.

## Possible Solutions

1. Achievements exists for every course and progress is only tracked within that course

2. Achievements are course independent and progress is tracked across all courses

## Chosen Solution

2. Achievements are course independent and progress is tracked across all courses

## Pro Chosen Solution

- No repetitive unlocking of the same achievements in different courses
- More options for long term achievements (complete five courses, ...)
- Easier to implement as it can be hardcoded instead of dynamically inserted

## Contra Chosen Solution

- Achievements are not course/content specific
- Someone who already achieved everything in i.e. the _PSE_ course will not get achievements in the _Theo_ course.
