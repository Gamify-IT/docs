# How to run all services

All services are available as docker containers. The preferred way to host is to use a `docker compose` file.

We provide a template in our [run-config](https://github.com/Gamify-IT/run-config) repository. There is also a [manual](https://github.com/Gamify-IT/run-config/hosting-template#setup) how to setup the hosting environment.
