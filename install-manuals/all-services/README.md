# How to run all services

## Prerequisite

### Install docker

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### Docker Desktop (not recommended for production use)

[Install Docker Desktop on windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

[Install Docker Desktop on linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/)

[Install Docker Desktop on macos](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

## Run

All services are available as docker containers. The preferred way to host is to use a `docker compose` file.

We provide a template in our [run-config](https://github.com/Gamify-IT/run-config) repository. There is also a [manual](https://github.com/Gamify-IT/run-config/hosting-template#setup) how to setup the hosting environment.
