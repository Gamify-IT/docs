- present: Martin, Levi

- absent unexcused: -

## What do we want to add?

- Pause menu with options menu and quit button.
- If the player pauses he loses 1 point per question to prevent abuse of pausing
- Should the pause menu stop the timer? Not 100% decided, but probably no
- Option to change mouse sensitivity
- Change the overlay of the game info so it can hold more text and is better scaleable with screen size
- A maximum magazine size of 2 to fit the shotgun theme, each question starts with 2 shots and if you need more you'll have to reload
- A small animation for reloading the weapon
- Game time is not static and can be configured by the lecturer, but there is a default time in case it is not set by the lecturer
- End screen can show how you answered the questions and indicates if the answer was right/ wrong

## What is left to do this sprint?

 - Finish refactoring of the code
 - Finish refactoring of the end screen
 - Refactor the game info overlay
 - Write testplans for the game

## What we did

- Change issue Gamify-IT/issues#192 from 13 story points to 8 because it wasn't realized that test plans are a separate issue with 5 story points already
