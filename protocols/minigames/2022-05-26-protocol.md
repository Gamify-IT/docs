## Transcript

- We added a new column for the different kinds of knowledge to our [concept board](https://uni-stuttgart.conceptboard.com/board/1izs-xzdk-kq1d-eepx-hfe1) and classified the different minigames.
- We noticed that our minigames rely on the fact that the student have learned all the required knowledge beforehand. We think that, as a learning platform, our game should also provide the students with the required information in-game.
    - If applicable: interactive tutorial within the game
    - Else:
        - professor can provide 1-3 relevant lecture slides
        - professor can input a hint/help text
    - Hint the correct solution when the student takes too long to answer
- Takeaways from our meetings
    - Bug-finder programm will be our sixth minigame
    - We only have a single game for the socializer and killer player type
    - Games can be optimized for the socializer by adding a conversation with an NPC or adding other social interactions with NPCs
        - E.g. an NPC asks you for help with finding a bug in his/her program and thanks you when you solved the task
    - Bloom's taxonomy: We should think about how we can teach the students the knowledge required for the games (see above)
