## Transcript

- We added a new column for the different kinds of knowledge to our [concept board](https://uni-stuttgart.conceptboard.com/board/1izs-xzdk-kq1d-eepx-hfe1) and classified the different minigames.
- We noticed that our minigames rely on the fact that the student have learned all the required knowledge beforehand. We think that, as a learning platform, our game should also provide the students with the required information in-game.
    - If applicable: interactive tutorial within the game
    - Else:
        - professor can provide 1-3 relevant lecture slides
        - professor can input a hint/help text
    - Hint the correct solution when the student takes too long to answer
