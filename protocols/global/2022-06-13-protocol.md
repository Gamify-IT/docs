## Planning

If we cannot finish an issue in one sprint, we create a new issue in the next sprint that refers to the old issue and we close the old issue.

We need another planning session after the unity seminar. We'll not plan everything ahead now but we'll continue in the middle of the sprint with the sprint planning.

## Daily

We'll do a daily in the future from **monday to thursday at 18:00 o'clock**. We discuss the following topics in the daily:

- What have I done since last time (to help the team or the finish sprint goals)?
- What am I doing till next time?
- What blocks me from my work?
