# Meeting Transcript 23.05.2022

General discussion on how to handle story on the platform.

- present: Gilian, Jonathan, Levi, Martin, Leon H
- absent excused: -
- absent unexcused: -

## When?

- idea: story only happens once you level up
  - makes integration easier
  - rewards replaying levels
- story could be completely decoupled from the overworld and minigames


## What?
  - i.e. protagonist lives in a 'dumb' world where he is the only one trying to learn
  - everyone else (NPCs) are stupid
  - Tutorial?
  - Leveling System = IQ?
  - Bossfights?
  - Ending?

## How?
  - player collects minigames in the overworld and plays them on his `GameBoy` (or something similar)
  - NPCs could give hints about minigame locations unknowingly
  - further hints in the overworld
  - minigames should also have a popup to explain how to play them
  - Humor (=Stupidity) will play a huge part?
  - Action by persecution from NPCs (robots?) GTA-like?
  - One minigame per Overworld area?
  - `Increased IQ changes perspective on the world`
    - reason why the art style changes with each level -> we can freely use asset packs 
    - problem: art style 'degrades' again when visiting a previous level
