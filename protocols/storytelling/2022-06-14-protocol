General discussion on how to handle story on the platform.

- present: Levi, Martin, Michael
- absent excused: -
- absent unexcused: -

## What?
  - Protagonist lives in a 'dumb' world where he is the only one trying to learn
  - Everyone else (NPCs, maybe apart from the `aliens`) are stupid
  - Leveling System = knowledge
  - Story is completely decoupled from the minigames
  - Humor (=Stupidity) will play a huge part!
  
## Earlygame
  ### Introduction 
    - Aliens conquer the world and want to stop the humanity from exploring space.
    - They make all humans stupid with their advanced technology.
    - The protagonist got braindamage in his early years and had to go through surgery. After the surgery the protagonist had a metal plate inside his head that reflected the stupid-rays. 
    - To overcome the danger of the aliens the humans have to get smarter again so they can fight back against the aliens.

## Midgame
  ### Lore 
    - NPCs tell some really short stories
    - Interactable lore pages
  ### Knowledge
    - Increase the knowledge level through successfully completing minigames.
      - How?
        - Player collects minigames in the overworld and plays them on his `GameBoy`
        - NPCs could give hints about minigame locations unknowingly
        - Action by persecution from NPCs (aliens)

## Endgame
  ### Ending 
    - After reaching a certain knowledge level the protagonist can invert the effects of the advanced technology and make the humans smart again.
    - The humans win the fight and are able to explore space.
