# Meeting Transcript 14.06.2022

General discussion on how to handle story on the platform.

- present: Levi, Martin, Michael
- absent excused: -
- absent unexcused: -

## What?
  - protagonist lives in a 'dumb' world where he is the only one trying to learn
  - everyone else (NPCs, maybe apart from the `police`) are stupid
  - Leveling System = knowledge
    - `knowledge reset` button?
    - pass on Gameboy to another person (-> next protagonist)?
  - story could be completely decoupled from the minigames
  - Humor (=Stupidity) will play a huge part!
  
## Earlygame
  - introduction 
    - aliens conquer the world and want to stop the humanity from exploring space.
    - therefore they make all humans with their advanced technology stupid.
    - the protagonist got braindamaged in his early years and had to be operated. After the operation the protagonist had a metal plate inside his head that reflected the stupid-rays. 
    - to overcome the danger of the aliens the humans have to get smarter again and fight the aliens back.

## Midgame
  - lore 
    - npc tell some really short stories
    - collectable lore pages
  - knowledge
    - increase the knowledge level through successfully finishing minigames.
      - How?
        - player collects minigames in the overworld and plays them on his `GameBoy` (or something similar)
        - NPCs could give hints about minigame locations unknowingly
        - Action by persecution from NPCs (robots?) GTA-like?

## Endgame
  - ending 
    - after reaching a specific knowledge level the protagonist can invert the effect of the advanced technology and make the humans smart again.
    - humans winn the fight and explore the space.
