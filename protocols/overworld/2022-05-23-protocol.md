# Meeting Transcript 23.05.2022

overworld design phase meeting

- present: Aaron, Florian, Gilian, Ilijaz, Jonathan, Leon H, Leon L, Levi, Martin, Michael, Timo

## problem asset packs

- different regions
- not so many good free asset packs
- travel to different worlds as an idea? (different asset pack per world)
- create own sprites? (very time intensive)

## overworld ideas

- npcs can block ways, or under construction sign etc.
- Idea:
  - puzzle piece levels, all levels same structure
  - lecturer can choose amount of levels
  - pieces can be added together dynamically
- Problems:
  - maybe too complex? different asset packs clashing
  - teleporter not so cool
  - seemless transitions are better

- put postprocessing filter over asset pack? for different regions
- Idea2:
  - Big Main overworld with best asset pack and small extra worlds with different less good asset packs?
  - load game cartrige as an idea so it seems natural that the design changes?
  - spaceships for travelling to other world?
- assets and sprites from other sources than unity store, like itch.io etc? [example](https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites)

- Idea3:
  - Overworld with different regions
