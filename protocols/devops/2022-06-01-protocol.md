## How to access SonarQube

- actual only within uni-vpn accessable
- discord voice chat is not accessable within the uni-vpn

Result:

- it isn't practicable to access SonarQube always within the uni-vpn
- cause of that we need make the SonarQube web interface accessable from the internet
- therefor we can ask Prof. Becker to setup a reverse proxy
- if this is not possible we maybe can set up a proxy at a student-hosted server
