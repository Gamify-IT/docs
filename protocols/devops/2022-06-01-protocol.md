## How to access SonarQube

- provided SonarQube instance is only accessable within uni network
- Discord voice chat is not accessable within the uni network
- VPN Setup takes a lot of time

## Result

- it isn't practicable to access SonarQube within the uni-vpn
- SonarQube web interface should accessable from the internet
- we can ask Prof. Becker to setup a reverse proxy
- if this is not possible, maybe we can set up a proxy at a student-hosted server
