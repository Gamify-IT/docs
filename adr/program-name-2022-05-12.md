# Which name should our project have?

## Proposals

- `Gamify-IT` (Current)
- `AWebaGa PlafoCoEdu @FirSem` ( _A web based gaming platform for computer science education in the first semesters_, GitHub slogan)
- `AWebaGa` (Pronouncable version of above)

## Result

We proposed the new names to the clients but were shut down.
The name stays as `Gamify-IT`.
