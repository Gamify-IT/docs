# How do we keep others informed?

Currently, it can only be guessed what other team members are doing, leading to confusion and disorganization.

## Possible Solutions

- keep the current approach
- everyone is responsible to track what they are currently doing in the GitHub organization project
  - Problem: Where are issues opened that don't belong to a repository (i.e. designing the storyline)?
  - Possible solutions:
    - do not open an issue for such tasks, simply use a draft in the organization project 
    - extra repo only to track such tasks
    - reuse the docs repo for that, label issues that are only in there because they don't fit anywhere else accordingly (i.e. by setting a corresponding milestone or label)
- everyone tracks what they are currently doing in an external management system (Jira, ...?)
