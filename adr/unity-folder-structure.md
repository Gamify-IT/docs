# Unity Folder Structure and File names

Currently our Folder and File structure in our unity project is not consistent.
There are Scripts in Scenes Folders, Scenes in no folder at all, etc. Also the Filenames do not follow a same Text Case.

## Possible Solutions

- Change nothing
- Only put files in the correct folders, which are correctly named.
  - for example put all World Scenes into the worlds folder
  - Scripts only in the scripts folder, with subfolders which are named to display where the script belongs to
    - also applies to all other stuff like prefabs, scenes, sprites, tiles, animations, ...
  - no longer needed scenes/scripts/etc. should be moved to "old" folder in the respective parent Folder.
    - or deleted?

## Pro changing nothing

- no extra work at the moment

## Pro consistent structure

- much more straightforward
- easier to find files
