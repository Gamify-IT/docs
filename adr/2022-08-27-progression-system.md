# Progression System

We need a system on how a player progresses and unlocks new dungeons and worlds.

## Possible Solutions

1. points for every minigame playthrough, enough points unlocks next area (multiple playthroughs accumulate points)
2. all minigames in the current area need to be played at least once
3. all minigames in the current area need to be played and completed (`highscore >= x`)
4. all highscores of all minigames in the current area are added, sum needs to be greater than `x`
5. all minigames in the current area need to be played and completed (`highscore >= x`) and average highscore of all minigame in that area needs to be greater than `y`
6. all minigames in the current area need to be played and completed (`highscore >= x`) and average highscore of all minigame in all areas needs to be greater than `y`

## Chosen Solution

3. all minigames in the current area need to be played and completed (`highscore >= x`)

## Pro Chosen Solution

- User knows exactly what to do
- All study content has to be understood to a certain degree
- No XP (knowledge) farming possible/ necessary

## Contra Chosen Solution

- Knowledge doesn't really have a purpose now
- User might get stuck and need help with a minigame to progress
