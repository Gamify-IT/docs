# States of Issues in the Project Board

In our GitHub Project Board for our Sprints we have multiple columns for different states of an issue.

## Chosen Solution

We have the following Columns:

### Backlog

Whenever we have an idea for a new issue, we can create one there.

### Ready for another Sprint

The issue can be moved from Backlog to here, when the issue is completely formulated. This includes the `Current Behavior`, `Expected Behavior`, and `Done` sections, where you define what the current behavior is, what the behavior should look like when the issue is closed. Checkpoints should also be created which show the steps that are needed to close the Issue. In case we can already estimate the workload of the issue, we should do it.

### Todo

Every Issue in this column should be closed by the end of the current Sprint. The workload of the issues should already be estimated.

### In Progress

The issues in this column have at least one assignee who is currently working on the issue.

### Ready for PR Review

All tasks in the issue were finished and are ready for review. A Pull-Request should be already created and reviewers are assigned.

### Done

All tasks are done and reviewed by other team members and are merged into the main branch.

### Accepted

The issue was accepted by the supervisors. Normally all issues from the last sprint should be in this column after a review with the supervisors.

### Cancelled

We do not want to delete issues if we figure out that we do not need or dont finish an issue. Instead, it should be documented why the issue was canceled inside the issue and it should be moved into this column.
