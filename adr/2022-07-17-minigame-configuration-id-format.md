# Formats minigame configuration id

Currently we have no clear format, in which format we create the configuration id's. The configuration id's generated by the minigame backends will be send to the overworld backend, so they know which configuration id should be load when entering a specific minigame.

## Possible Solutions

- UUID format
    - base64 + `_` + `-`
