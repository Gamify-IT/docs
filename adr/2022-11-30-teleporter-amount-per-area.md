# Teleporter amount per world

We need to know how many teleporters are in each area.

## Possible Solutions

1. There is exactly one teleporter in each area

2. There can be more than one teleporter in each area

3. Klick on map (that shows the unlocked areas) and tp (teleport) to click if klick is valid

## Chosen Solution

There can be more than one teleporter in each area

## Pro Chosen Solution

- The player is more flexible
- More interactions with the world

## Contra Chosen Solution

- Implementation is harder because a teleporter object cannot be bound to a scene
- Teleports may be overused by the player so that interactables like minigames may be overlooked
