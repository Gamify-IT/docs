In the first meeting i had big problems following the conversation of our frontend structure, f.e. the overworld and other microservices.
I dont have to understand every detail but it would be nice to follow the converstion.

Maybe we can define some of the components (and espatially how WE use them) in the next meetings.

The ones i remember are:

1. We have a microservice architecture. So why cant the different backend aspects be written in different languages? Why does it have to be only GO?

2. What is an IFrame, and how do we use them?

3. What is a DOM?

(i will extend this list if i remember more.)
