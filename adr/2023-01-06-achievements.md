# Achievements

We need to know whether achievements should exist for every course or course independent.

## Possible Solutions

1. Achievements exists for every course and progress is only tracked within that course

2. Achievements are course independent and progress is tracked across all courses

## Chosen Solution

2. Achievements are course independent and progress is tracked across all courses

## Pro Chosen Solution

- No repetetive unlocking of the same achievements in different courses
- More options for long term achievements (complete five courses, ...)

## Contra Chosen Solution

- Less achievements to complete in every course, so less motivating for players
