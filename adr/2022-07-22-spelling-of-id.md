# How do we spell "ID" (and similar acronyms) in Code?

`ID` and all other acronyms are controversial identifiers for variables.  
We need an agreement on how to write it.  
The following pargraphs use only `ID` as example, but the result can be applied to every other acronym as well (`XML`, `HTTP`, `REST`, `RPC`, `JSON`, ...).

## Possible Solutions

- `id` if there is no prefix, `-ID` otherwise (i.e. `lectureID`)
- `id` if there is no prefix, `-Id` otherwise (i.e. `lectureId`)

## Chosen Solution

- `id` if there is no prefix, `-Id` otherwise (i.e. `lectureId`)

## Pro `-Id`

- Conforms with the way many (Java) libraries handle it

## Contra `-Id`

- Incorrect spelling of `ID`
