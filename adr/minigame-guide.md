# How do we enhance the feeling of our minigames?

Currently, all minigames are playable at best. But each minigame could be enhanced by adding a common set of actions.

## Possible Solutions (Multiple are possible)

- do nothing
- add a main menu, possibly even with a button to get a quick introduction on how to play the game
- Add sound effects/ music to the games, at best as a free asset?
- add a close button for each minigame, or better an overlay to return back to the overworld
