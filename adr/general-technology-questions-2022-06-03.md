# General Technology Questions

In the first meeting i had big problems following the conversation of our frontend structure, f.e. the overworld and other microservices.
I dont have to understand every detail but it would be nice to follow the conversation.

Maybe we can define some of the components (and espatially how WE use them) in the next meetings.

The ones i remember are:

1. We have a microservice architecture. So why cant the different backend aspects be written in different languages? Why does it have to be only GO?
  Answer: Everyone can use the language he wants. Atleast 2 other persons should be able to read/ edit the code.
  
2. What is an IFrame, and how do we use them?
  Answer: Little Website inside another website.
  
3. What is a DOM?
  Answer: A Website (only HTML).
  
4. Microservice Communication?
  Answer: probably rest.
  
5. Where is the data stored for each microservice?
  Answer: w.i.p. (probably in multiple databases SQL + noSQL)

(i will extend this list if i remember more.)
