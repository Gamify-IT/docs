# States of Issues in the Project Board

In our GitHub Project Board for our Sprints we have multiple columns for different states of an issue.

## Chosen Solution
We have the following Columns:

### Backlog
Whenever we have an idea for a new issue, we can create one there.

### Ready for another Sprint
The issue can be moved from the Backlog here when the issue is completely written. This includes the points `Current Behavior`, `Expected Behavior`, and `Done` sections, where you define what the current behavior is, what the behavior should look like when the issue is finished, and what the checkpoints are that you can call your issue done. In case we can already estimate the issue, we should do it.

### Todo
For all the issues located in this column, we want to finish the tasks in the issue for the current sprint. The issues should already be estimated.

### In Progress
The issue has at least one assignee who is currently working on the issue.

### Ready for PR Review 
All tasks in the issue were finished and ready for review. A Pull-Request should be already created and review requested from other team members.

### Done
All tasks are done and reviewed by other team members and are merged.

### Accepted
The issue was accepted by the supervisors. Normally all issues from the last sprint should be in this column after a review with the supervisors.

### Cancelled
We do not want to delete issues when we figure out that we do not need or finish an issue. Instead, it should be documented why it was canceled in the issue and should be moved in this column.
