# How do we keep the meeting size small?

Currently, too many people attend the meetings. Oftentimes, (almost) every team member participates.

- ~50-75% of attendees do not participate actively in the meeting
   -> can be more productive
- it would be better if everyone specializes on a small topic
  - where they decide how to proceed instead of letting everyone discuss the big picture without getting anything done

## Possible Solutions

- keep the current approach
- split all group members into teams of two people specializing on one aspect
- split all group members into teams of three people specializing on one aspect

## Chosen Solution

- split into smaller teams with variable size
