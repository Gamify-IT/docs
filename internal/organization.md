# General

- DOKU] How to display? Wiki/ README/ markdown/ pdf?
- DOKU] Central place for docs.
Should include:
- [DOKU] Dev Tutorial: Examples for adding a new minigame, Architecture, Testing structure, How to run project.
- Toggl Time Track: If something takes too long it should be trackable by toggl, even if nothing is available
- ADR: Architecural Decision Records: architecture decisions made together and why. Template on <https://adr.github.io/madr/> : Describe the problem with pros and cons,
- (overkill: readthedocs)
- User manual (how the user can operate it): "he just has to understand it".
- Pro service clean README: how to start, how structured,...
- Protocols: small record of meeting results and who did what -> to argue.
- Pro review: Build presentation with progress, and what to expect. Maybe also include SonarQube stats as a screenshot.
- To start review: List of roles, and when exactly to expect minimal running example.
- how to design project day-to-day?
- Effort estimation / Storypoints / Planning Poker -> with storypoints task durations can be estimated well, if a storypoint takes about 5 hours (or less, depending on gusto)
  - no task larger than X: break down into subtasks
- Planning and Refinement: everyone must be clear at the beginning what needs to be done. Also recommended: Build up experts (areas).
- Two-week sprints are recommended
- Review: x tasks done, y storypoints estimated, e.g. when people send me their toggle times (icing on the cake).
  - Giving rough overview: What got done?
  - Pass on to individual implementers: how exactly was it done?
  - Schedule retreat periods and summer vacations! (E.g. because there are only 3 in one week)
- Docu Repo: How to add service, Dev doc, User doc, (readthedocs...), setup, CI/ CD (i.e. Jenkins/ SonarQube), IDE setup, ADR, ReST API
- Milestones/ Releases: Freely selectable, probably not so useful here, MVP
- Concerning Deploy: Maybe ask BW Cloud, but there can be downtime because it's free.
- Discord Bot for notifications? Rather not.
- Forward docu stuff to docu responsible.
- How to build review slides:
  - Agenda: Overview
  - Goals: What happened? What was planned? Has it been implemented? If not, why?
  - If present: Events (i.e. developer leaves team).
  - Numbers: how many tickets in total, ...
  - Kuhn diagram?
  - SonarQube Statistics -> For DevOps, i.e. Iliaz, but only when everything is working.
  - Presentation of own features by the developers
  - Next steps
  - Concentrate on the essentials
  - (Retrospective)
