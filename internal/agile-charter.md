# Agile Charter

This document presents an overview of the roles, our intended goals and our working agreements. It should help us to identify risks or boundaries and to focus on our main goal. Every team member committed to this file.

## Purpose

### Vision

For students in the first semester, the "Gamify-IT" is a online learning platform that teaches computer science basics through minigames.
Unlike ordinary lectures, our product takes a different approach by combining learning with gamification aspects.

### Mission

We build a online 

- minigame platform
- static world you progress by completing minigames
- replacable and interchangable minigame content
- (you can learn smth)
- easy to extend with more minigames
- easy to access through the browser

### Mission Tests (ggf. DoD)

- [ ] Users can successfully register and login to the platform
- [ ] An overworld exists where users can wander around and start minigames
- [ ] At least 5 minigames exist
- [ ] Minigames are independent components
- [ ] The minigames can be played as intended
- [ ] A progression system (-> gamification) exists
- [ ] The entire platform can be used by a desktop browser
- [ ] All Code Guidelines have been met
- [ ] The customers (Professor Becker et al.) are happy

## Alignment

### Values & Principles

- Availability: We check our discord chats once every working day and answer them
