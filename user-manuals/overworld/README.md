# Overworld

The overworld is the core of the Gamify-IT platform.
It is the main interface for students to interact with the platform.

The overworld consists of multiple regions and dungeons.
Throughout the world, students can discover course contents in form of [minigames](../README.md) and NPC dialogues.
