# Tower Defense

Tower Defense is a minigame which is part of the Gamify-IT platform.

## About the Game

The intention with this game is to make answering single choice questions fun.

When entering the game, the user is presented with the main menu.


After pressing the start button the enemies start spawning. The player then can place towers along the road to kill the enemies. Everytime the player wants to place a tower he must answer a question correctly to do so.

The player also can upgrade the towers to make them stronger, for each upgrade he also must answer a question correctly.


Once too many enemies reach the base the game ends. The longer the player survives the more points he can earn. 

## User Interface

When you start the game, the game map with the UI elements will be loaded. In the top left-hand corner you have a pause button and a speed up button. You can switch between standard pace and double pace. Next to the buttons, there is a life bar representing your current amount of health points.

At the beginning of the game, the shop menu is expanded allowing you to choose between towers with different attack styles. In the top left-hand corner of the shop menu you can see the current amount of currency available to you. After left-clicking on a tower you can move the cursor to the preferred position on the map and place the tower by left-clicking again. You can collapse the shop menu by clicking on the shop icon at the right-hand side.

When your life is empty, the game ends and you will be directed to the game over screen, where you can choose between going back to the start menu or leaving the game.
