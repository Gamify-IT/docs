# Tower Defense

Tower Defense is a minigame which is part of the Gamify-IT platform.

## About the Game

The intention with this game is to make answering single choice questions fun.

When entering the game, the user is presented with the main menu.


After pressing the start button the enemies start spawning. The player then can place towers along the road to kill the enemies. Everytime the player wants to place a tower he must answer a question correctly to do so.

The player also can upgrade the towers to make them stronger, for each upgrade he also must answer a question correctly.


Once too many enemies reach the base the game ends. The longer the player survives the more points he can earn. 

## Configuration

The lecturer can configure the game with an arbitrary number of questions.

Each question has a single correct answer and an arbitrary number of wrong answers.
The lecturer can also configure the time limit for the game.
