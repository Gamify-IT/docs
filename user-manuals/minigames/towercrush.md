When entering the game, the user is presented with a lobby search screen.
Once the user joined a lobby they can choose one of two teams to join and can ready up.
If every user in the lobby has chosen a team and readied up, the players can start the game by clicking the Start button.
The users can only go to the next question once every member of the team has voted for their preferred answer.
Teams get rewarded with points for every question they answered correctly, the aim of the game is to keep the tower of your team alive by getting as many points as possible.

Once a team has answered every question, or one of the team's towers reaches zero the game ends.

The winning team is the one whose tower is the last one standing, or whichever team has answered more questions correctly.
