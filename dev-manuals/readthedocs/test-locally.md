# How to test the ReadTheDocs pages locally

1. Ensure the environment has been set up as described [here](./setup-locally.md)
2. Execute `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Execute `make html` to build the Sphinx page
4. _ReadTheDocs_ will be updated automatically once a new commit has been made to the default branch
