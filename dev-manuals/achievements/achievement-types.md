# Achievement Types

This file describes the different types of achievements and how they affect different player types.

## Concept

Different achievements influence players at a different strength, based on which player type they are. The nature of the task is relevant to which player types are best addressed.

## Player Types

There are four different player types, for further information about the characteristics of each type check out the [gamification](../gamification/README.md) concept.

### Killer

The killer compares himself with others and wants to be the best at all costs.  
Typical achievements would be something like this: `Kill x enemies`, `Reach 1st place on the leaderboard`, ...  
For Gamify-IT, achievements like `Reach 1st place on the leaderboard` or `Win x rounds of Towercrush` are possible.

### Achiever

The achiever wants to progress as fast as possible and doesn't really care about unnecessary side quests.  
Typical achievements would be something like this: `Reach level x`, `Complete chapter x`, ...  
For Gamify-IT, achievements like `Complete world x` or `Unlock all areas` are possible.

### Explorer

The explorer wants to explore the world and find hidden areas and items.  
Typical achievements would be something like this: `Find x hidden objects`, ...  
For Gamify-IT, achievements like `Find all easter eggs`, `Travel a distance of x tiles` or `Activate all teleporters` are possible.

### Socializer

The socializer wants to interact and work together with other players.  
Typical achievements would be something like this: `Add x friends`, `Player x rounds of multiplayer`, ...  
For Gamify-IT, achievements like `Player x rounds of Towercrush` or `Player x times with the same player` are possible.

## Achievement goals

Completely (not shown at all until unlocked) or partially hidden (only title visible until unlocked) achievements can be an additional motivation to play. This is especially true for explorers and achievers.  
But every player has all player types at his own personal weighting, that means that all achievements are relevant for all players, just at different importance.  
It is important that the achievement has a purpose.  
A player has to get it either by progressing in the game or by doing something special.  
No achievement should be earned simply by investing an absurd amount of time such as `Play 10.000 minigames`, `Reach 1.000 times a result of 100%` or `Travel a distance of 100.000.000 tiles`.  
Achievements should not exist for every course, but be independent and across all courses. Otherwise, the player has to complete the same challenges in different courses to earn the same achievement multiple times, which is very demotivating and would result in significantly less player actively trying to complete achievements.
