## Description

## Postcondition

The active status of an area was updated and is shown in the view.

## Typical procedure

1. Click the active switch button of an area (select world/dungeon by static name)
2. The switch button inverted the `active` state.
3. Depending on the previous state:
    - If the area was previously not active, a success message appears
