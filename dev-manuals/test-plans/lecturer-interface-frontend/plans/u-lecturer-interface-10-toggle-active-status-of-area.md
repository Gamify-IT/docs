Author: Max KÃ¤stner

## Description

The active status of a world or dungeon (which is linked to the world of a view) can be changed on the world view.

## Precondition

At least one course with a world is created. The tester is located where the area can be configured.

## Postcondition

The active status of an area was updated and is shown in the view.

## Typical procedure

1. Click the active switch button of an area (select world/dungeon by static name)
2. The switch button inverted the `active` state.
3. Depends on the status before:
    - In case the area was not active before, a green toast message appears which contains the area was activated
    - In case the area was active before, a red toast message appears which contains the area was deactivated
