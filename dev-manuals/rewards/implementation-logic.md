## Implementation Logic:

1. Reward Calculation and Data Management

In the backend, reward calculation and player data management are efficiently handled to ensure a smooth and responsive gaming experience. 
Each time a minigame is played, the backend processes the data received from the frontend to compute the rewards earned by each player. 
This process includes updating the player’s rewards, managing their anonymity settings, and storing their pseudonym in the player statistics.

2. Real-Time Updates and Leaderboard Refresh
The player statistics, including information such as rewards and pseudonym status, are fetched from the backend whenever the overworld is loaded. 
This ensures that the player’s current status and rewards are accurately reflected each time they access the game environment. 
As players engage in minigames within the overworld, their performance data is processed immediately. 
This real-time processing updates the rewards earned and recalculates the player’s position on the leaderboard. 
The leaderboard is dynamically refreshed to display the latest rankings and reward totals, providing players with up-to-date information on their progress and standing.

3. Pseudonym and Anonymity Management
Any changes to a player’s pseudonym or anonymity settings are promptly updated in the backend repository. 
This ensures that updates are reflected in the player’s profile and leaderboard visibility, as soon as the game is loaded.
By managing these settings in real-time, the system maintains the integrity of the gaming experience, allowing players to seamlessly control their 
privacy and display preferences.

Overall, this implementation ensures that player data is accurately managed and updated correctly, 
enhancing the overall gameplay experience and ensuring fair and transparent competition.
