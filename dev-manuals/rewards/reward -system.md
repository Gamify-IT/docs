# Reward System

This file describes how the rewards are distributed amongst the minigames

## Motivation for a reward system

Motivation through Competition:

1. Leagues create a natural sense of competition among participants. People tend to engage more when they can compete with others. 
This competition boosts motivation by sparking the desire for improvement and progress.

2. Encouragement of Progress and Achievement:
Leagues offer a way to visualize progress. Participants can move up from lower ranks, which gives them a sense of accomplishment. 
The ongoing goal of advancing to a higher league drives participants to invest more time and effort.

3. Skill-Based Grouping of Players:
Leagues group players by skill level, ensuring they compete against others of similar abilities. 
This promotes fair competition and ensures that the game remains both challenging and accessible.

4. Long-Term Engagement:
Leagues help sustain long-term participation. Regular progression within a league, or the desire not to fall behind, 
keeps participants involved and encourages continuous use of the game or system.

## Minigames and their reward system

All minigames (except Memory) follow the structure outlined below:

For the first 3 rounds, players receive 10 rewards for every 100 scored points. 
After the first 3 rounds, the reward calculation changes: the final reward is determined by dividing the player's score by 10. 
This ensures that players cannot manipulate their placement on the leaderboard by repeatedly playing the same game to accumulate rewards without limit. 
The change in reward structure after three rounds encourages fair competition and prevents excessive point farming.

Additionally, in memory-based games, the downward adjustment in rewards happens more quickly. 
This is because players tend to memorize the card patterns faster than in other minigames, allowing them to achieve higher scores in less time. 
To account for this, the reward decrease is applied more aggressively to ensure that memorization alone doesn't lead to disproportionate leaderboard advantages.

## Ingame usage of rewards 

Additionally, the rewards are also redeemable in the shop. 
In exchange, players can acquire new outfits or accessories, enhancing their in-game customization options.
