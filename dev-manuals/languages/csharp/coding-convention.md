# Coding Convention

## Text Cases

Class names in PascalCase:  `class StringToDisplay`  
Namespaces in PascalCase:    `Unity.Behavior`  
Method names in PascalCase: `ToString()`  
Variable names in camelCase: `textToDisplay`  

Since the rules are complicated, this can be read [here](https://github.com/ktaranov/naming-convention/blob/master/C%23%20Coding%20Standards%20and%20Naming%20Conventions.md) again.

## Positioning of curly braces

Curly braces (`{}`) are each on a separate line.
