From 31.12. the Unity license changes, which is why - if nothing is changed by us until then - the autobuild in the CI will no longer work. See below the email from Unity.

Hello,
 
We wanted to let you know about an important change coming to your Unity license.
 
The existing Unity Analytics (now Legacy Unity Analytics) tools included with your Unity license, and accessed from within the Unity Editor, are being closed for new project adoption as of June 22, 2022. This functionality is being replaced by a new analytics tool, Unity Gaming Services (UGS) Analytics.
 
UGS Analytics is a new and improved service that can be accessed from within the Unity Dashboard. UGS Analytics includes a free tier and a paid tier for high-consumption projects.
 
For current projects that are actively using the Legacy Unity Analytics service, Unity is providing a data migration tool for basic events, and a migration guide for custom events. For projects that are not actively using Legacy Unity Analytics, there will be no change or action required for your project. Access to project data for Legacy Unity Analytics projects will shut down as of December 31st, 2022. Data not migrated by that date will be lost.
 
For more information on the migration, to find our migration guide, read our FAQ. You can also reach out to Unity customer support or speak with your account client partner if you have any other questions or concerns about this migration.
 
Regards,
 
Unit
