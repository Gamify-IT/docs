# creating issues

## Estimate

### Story points (SP)

Story points: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13`

One story point is `4 hours` of working time for each person. That means if there is a `2 hour` meeting with `5 people` the issue at least takes `10 hours` so that would be `2 - 3 Story points`

## Scope

Contains:

- Planning of the issue
- Execution of the issue
- Meetings
- Testing
