# Creating issues

## Estimate

### Story points (SP)

Story points: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13`

One story point is `5 hours` of working time for each person. That means if there is a `2 hour` meeting with `5 people` the issue at least takes `10 hours` so that would be `2 - 3 Story points`

## Scope

Contains:

- Planning of the issue
- Execution of the issue
- Meetings
- Testing

## Content of the issue
Issues should be created on Gropius. They should contain a short and meaningful title, as well as a detailed 
explanation of the issue. There should also be criteria (as a checklist) to gauge whether the issue is done or not.

Furthermore, tags and relations should be set and a person should be assigned at least when the issue goes into `in progress`.
